# Collected data for analytical approach to estimate risk of accidents.

The paper "BI-OBJECTIVE APPROACH TO DEAL WITH ACCIDENT RISK AND LOGISTIC COST IN VEHICLE ROUTING PROBLEM" intends to develop an analytical approach based on simple statistical calculations coupled with two multi-criteria methods in a CVRP model to analysing the trade-off between logistical cost and accident risk measured by a cost. This document represent the all collected and processed real data used to the analytical approach and they are collected from: 
- National Transport Confederation (CNT) - ( https://cnt.org.br/acidentes-rodoviarios-caminhoes); 
- Department of Roads and Highways of the State of Sao Paulo (DER-SP) - (www.der.sp.gov.br/WebSite/MalhaRodoviaria/PesquisaRodovias.aspx);
- National Department of Transport Infrastructure (DNIT) - (www.servicos.dnit.gov.br/dadospnct/Modelagem);

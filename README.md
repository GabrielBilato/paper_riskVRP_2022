# Collected data for analytical approach to estimate risk of accidents

The paper "BI-OBJECTIVE APPROACH TO DEAL WITH ACCIDENT RISK AND LOGISTIC COST IN VEHICLE ROUTING PROBLEM" intends to develop an analytical approach based on simple statistical calculations coupled with two multi-criteria methods in a CVRP model to analysing the trade-off between logistical cost and accident risk measured by a cost. This document represent the all collected and processed real data used to the analytical approach and they are from: the National Transport Confederation (CNT), the Department of Roads and Highways of the State of Sao Paulo (DER-SP), the National Department of Transport Infrastructure (DNIT) and load insurance company.
